# Camera Calibration

If youâ€™re not using cameras in 3D mode, calibration is optional, but it can still offer benefits. Calibrating cameras helps refine the pitch and yaw values, leading to more accurate positional data in every mode.

## Print the Calibration Target

- Downloaded from our [demo site](https://demo.photonvision.org/#/cameras), or directly from your coprocessors cameras tab.
- Use the Charuco calibration board:
  - Layout: 8x8 grid of 1-inch squares.
  - Markers: 4x4 dictionary with 0.75-inch markers.

## Prepare the Calibration Target

- Measure Accurately: Use calipers to measure the actual size of the squares and markers. Precise measurements are crucial for effective calibration.
- Ensure Flatness: The calibration board must be perfectly flat, without any wrinkles or bends, to avoid introducing errors into the calibration process.

## Calibrate your Camera

- Take lots of photos: It's recommended to capture more than 50 images to properly calibrate your camera for accuracy. 12 is the bare minimum and may not provide good results.
- Other Tips
  - Move the board not the camera.
  - Take photos of lots of angles: The more angles the more better (up to 45 deg).
  - A couple of up close images is good.
  - Cover the entire cameras fov.
  - Avoid images with the board facing straight towards the camera.
